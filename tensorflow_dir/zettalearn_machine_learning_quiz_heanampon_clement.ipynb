    "Functions are needed to create a set of instructions that are being used repeatedly. Functions can be complex and because of that they are etter self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. Functions allow us to keep our variable namespace clean (local variables only \"live\" as long as the function does). In other words, function_1 can use a variable called i, and function_2 can also use a variable called i and there is no confusion."
